        <p>The journey to web development has been good so far.Using freecodecamp has really helped me to know how to code some various instructions, styling and knowing some basic principes needed in creating websites and hosting them.My journey to becoming a web developer from scratch without a CS degree wasn't easy . Today I’m going to fill you in on what went right, and what didn’t, so that if you’re embarking on this journey, you’ll have better luck than I did.</p>

    <br>I first stumbled upon FreeCodeCamp when I was stuck in a job that didn’t excite me anymore. I’d always been interested in technology but didn’t know where to start. The idea of learning coding seemed intimidating, and I had no formal background in computer science. However, after a few weeks of research, I decided to give FreeCodeCamp a shot. What did I have to lose? The first few lessons were eye-opening. The way FreeCodeCamp breaks down programming concepts into bite-sized chunks made the whole thing feel accessible, even for someone with no prior experience. The HTML and CSS sections felt like a creative playground. I could instantly see results when I tweaked code and refreshed my browser, which was incredibly satisfying.</p>

    <br>The biggest change in my life, however, wasn’t just the technical skills I acquired. It was the mental shift. I realized that with consistent effort and the right mindset, I could solve problems I once thought were impossible. I learned how to be patient with myself and how to approach problems methodically. Coding became not just a career path, but a mindset. After about a year of consistent work through FreeCodeCamp, I felt ready to apply for junior developer roles. I landed my first gig as a front-end developer, and the sense of achievement was overwhelming. FreeCodeCamp didn’t just teach me how to code—it transformed my approach to learning and problem-solving. Looking back, the journey wasn’t just about getting a job—it was about building the confidence to try something new, overcome obstacles, and continue learning every day.</br>
